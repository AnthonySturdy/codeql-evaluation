### Utilising Ray Marching and Signed Distance Functions to Render a Scene of Primitives
A ray marched rendering engine developed for the final year "Games Technology Research Project" module, also referred to as a Final Year Project. The research and development of this artefact, along with the report, spanned across the majority of the final year of University.

The engine uses signed distance functions to render objects, and provides a GUI to interact with the objects within the scene and apply various visual effects.

This project was developed using DirectX11 and C++. ImGui was used for the GUI library and DirectXTK was used for the initial codebase (window handling, etc), as well as for the helper libraries included such as SimpleMath. A 15,000 word report was written alongside the development of the artefact which researched the history of rendering techniques, as well as features of ray marching. The report then analysed different options for the direction of this project followed by the decided design of the project, how it will be planned and how the project will be managed. The report then describes the implementation process of the research followed by a critical evaluation.
